## Reproducibility

### Open Data

All primary data necessary for reproducing the results is in the `/raw_data` subfolder:

- `Rep01_anonymized.csv`: The study data (item ratings, raw text of writing assignment)
- `Rep01_demographics_anonymized.csv`: The demographic data of the final sample. ATTENTION: For privacy reasons within the course itself (where students might have participation knowledge of specific individuals), the order in this data set was randomized, so that the rows do not match the rows in `Rep01_anonymized.csv`. Do NOT try to merge these two data sets.
- `Rep01_ratings.xlsx`

The data dictionary is in `doc/Data_Dictionary.ods`.

### Open Reproducible Code

- Set the working directory to the root folder of this project.
- There is no need to re-run the script `0a-merge_ratings.R`. This only needs to be done when new data with new writing assignments comes in.
- To reproduce all results, run the scripts `0b-preprocessing.R` to `4-exploratory_analyses.R` in the numerical order.

### Reproducible Manuscript

`manuscript/manuscript.qmd` is the manuscript in apaquarto format. It first sources all R files to make the objects available and then dynamically creates the numbers in the manuscript.
